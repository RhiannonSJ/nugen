This code tests GENIEHelper and CRYHelper

To run it, edit evgentest.fcl as follows:

line 1: change Geometry.fcl to the name of the file containing your geometry configuration
line 24: change @local::geometry to @local::XXX where XXX is the name of your geometry configuration
line 46: change the value of TopVolume to correspond to the top volume in your geometry for GENIE production
then

<exe> -c evgentest.fcl 

will run the test, where <exe> is the name of your executable, ie nova, lar, etc.
